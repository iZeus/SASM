====

SASM (Sedlar ASM) is a modified and extended version of OW2's ASM tree API, created with allowing ease of development.

Thanks to:<br />
    - Eric Bruneton and Eugene Kuleshov for creating OW2's ASM tree API.<br />
    - Finn Thompson for giving me the idea of a jquery selector styled instruction searcher.
